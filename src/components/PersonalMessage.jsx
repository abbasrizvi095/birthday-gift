        <h2>Happy Birthday, my love! 🥳💖</h2>
        <p>
          Today is your day, and I just want to pause and remind you how deeply thankful I am to walk through life with you by my side. Seriously… you’re my sunshine, my safe place, my laughter on the hard days, and the calm in all the chaos. Your smile? It lights up my whole world. Your laugh? Still my favorite sound ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know things didn’t go quite as we planned and we couldn’t celebrate the way we had hoped — and I’m really sorry for that. But I still wanted to bring a little sparkle to your day. So… I made something just for you: a little website full of love, just for you. 💻💝 I hope it brings a smile to your face and reminds you how much you mean to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope this year wraps you up in joy, brings you deep, real love, and fills your life with the kind of memories that stay in your heart forever. You truly deserve all of it—and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can’t wait to keep making magic with you, through every ordinary day and every unexpected twist. 💫
        </p>
        <p>
          Here’s to your year — may it be the most beautiful one yet. I love you endlessly. 💕✨
